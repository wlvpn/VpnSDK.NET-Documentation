    "keywords": "Migrating From VpnSDK v1 to v2 Introduction Migrating a codebase using the original VpnSDK release requires updating from the original reactive/observable flow to the standard asynchronous and event patterns found in modern day C#. While reactive code can provide developers with the ability to manage more complex codebases, the new task/event-based model in v2 allows for faster iteration by any C# developer without having to know the in's and out's of reactive programming. [!WARNING] <Customers who have used a branded version of ConsumerVPN with v1 are suggested to follow our branding guide and use ConsumerVPN v2 as a fresh base.> While this guide is not aimed at how to adapt v2 in to a similar interface found in v1, using System.Reactive , developers more comfortable with the reactive programming model can convert the tasks and events in v2 to observable processes. Make sure to read the quick start guide first as it will help show the simplification of the API in v2. The most significant changes that will affect your codebase can be found by comparing the v1 quick start guide to the v2 version . Constructing the SDK Instance [!TIP] <Most namespaces have up from VpnSDK.Public to the root namespace of VpnSDK. Review the API documentation for specifics.> Constructing an instance of the SDK is similar to v1 which uses a builder pattern. SDKBuilder now requires providing the type ISDK as a generic to assist in versioning the main SDK interface. This is as simple as changing new SDKBuilder() to new SDKBuilder<ISDK>() . For applications using IKEv2, RasConfiguration remains the same and for applications using OpenVPN, extraneous diagnostic log file related properties have been removed as all diagnostic logs are now handled through using LibLog to automatically supply log entries to any standard .NET logging framework. Compare the differences between building an SDK instance in ConsumerVPN v1 and v2. // VpnSDK v1 new SDKBuilder() .SetApiKey(Helpers.Resource.Get<string>(\"API_KEY\")) .SetApplicationName(Helpers.Resource.Get<string>(\"BRAND_NAME\")) .SetAuthenticationToken(Helpers.Resource.Get<string>(\"AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN\")) .SetLogFilesPath(logFilesPath) .SetServerListCache(TimeSpan.FromDays(1)) .SetOpenVpnConfiguration(new OpenVpnConfiguration { OpenVpnCertificateFileName = \"ca.crt\", OpenVpnDirectory = \"OpenVPN\", OpenVpnExecutableFileName = \"openvpn.exe\", OpenVpnConfigDirectory = \"OpenVPN\", OpenVpnConfigFileName = \"config.ovpn\", OpenVpnLogFileName = \"openvpn.log\", TapDeviceDescription = \"TAP-Windows Adapter V9\", TapDeviceName = \"tap0901\" }) .SetRasConfiguration(new RasConfiguration { RasDeviceDescription = Resource.Get<string>(\"BRAND_NAME\") }) .Create(); // VpnSDK v2 new SDKBuilder<ISDK>() .SetApiKey(Resource.Get<string>(\"ApiKey\")) .SetAuthenticationToken(Resource.Get<string>(\"AuthenticationToken\")) .SetApplicationName(Resource.Get<string>(\"ApplicationName\")) .SetAutomaticRefreshTokenHandling(true) .SetServerListCache(TimeSpan.FromDays(1)) .Create(); VpnSDK v2 has sane defaults in construction and no longer requires as much specification. ISDK ISDK operations are no longer subscribed to but rather invoked and awaited on. For cases where a task doesn't apply, like an external case of a user being logged out, there are standard C# events that can be subscribed to at any time. All events will be invoked on the same thread that the SDK is created on by default as to provide UI safe events without requiring extra effort from the developer to marshal events between threads. The interface of the main SDK instance has changed significantly as a result and the API reference for the class should be directly reviewed here . For any functionality not covered below, the API reference will have an equivalent event and task using similar patterns as demonstrated. Authentication All authentication and data loading now occurs within the Login(username, password) task. When user authentication fails, an appropriate exception will be fired for the cause of error and this should be expected of all async calls within the SDK. The AuthenticationStatusChanged event can be subscribed to at any time to monitor whether the user has logged in or not and the AuthenticationCredentialsExpired event provides notification on when a users credentials have expired. If you are currently using a callback method in v1 for the login subscription, your exception catch clause for Login and the previous two mentioned events will serve as replacements. Locations (Regions) The RegionsList collection has now been renamed to Locations and changed to a ReadOnlyObservableCollection . Rather than providing a feed of locations that the application needs to keep track of, a standard read-only observable collection is provided to simplify usage as developers were converting this observable in to a collection within their own code which can now be removed. WhenLocationListChanged can be replaced with the Locations.CollectionChanged event. Unlike v1, Locations is automatically populated on login regardless of any subscriptions, so boilerplate code to observe WhenLocationListChanged can be removed. VPN Connectivity The Connect and Disconnect methods still require the same signatures as before but are now tasks. Just like authentication, when either of these operations fail an exception will fire on the awaiter. Upon awaiting both of these methods it's safe to assume the VPN is connected/disconnected. VpnConnectionStatusChanged should be subscribed to make sure that in cases where the VPN tunnel is severed or connecting, the UI is updated without having to share the task's status throughout your UI code. This event should call what was once the .Subscribe callback of .Connect in v1. Diagnostic Logs Logging has changed from being automatically written to a file by the SDK to instead using LibLog to provide logs throughout the SDK to most logging frameworks under the VpnSDK::* namespace. While we suggest using Serilog in your application, most are supported by default. To keep VpnSDK logs separated, use the appropriate namespace filtering option in your logging framework to make anything that starts with VpnSDK:: write to a different file. Conclusion Migrating from the v1 SDK to v2 will require moving away from the existing observable pattern found through v1 and instead use standard async patterns. To speed up your migration, you should ensure to review and compare the v1 and v2 documentation, especially the API reference. All of the example code repositories provide both v1 and v2 branches that serve as an easy way to compare the differences between the two versions and find equivalent code examples rapidly."

    "keywords": "Branding ConsumerVPN Provided to you is a copy of the example ConsumerVPN v2 client, a base application that can be easily modified to work with your design. Architected to be simple to iterate on, for most WLVPN partners, you will find yourself using it as a launching point. Requirements You will need to become a registered WLVPN reseller to run the application. If you have not done so already, please visit https://wlvpn.com/#contact to get started. To create your own application from this template, you will need a copy of Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 (preferred). This can be obtained from here: https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/ Once Visual Studio has been installed, you will need to clone or download the repository for the ConsumerVPN application found at https://github.com/wlvpn/ConsumerVPN-v2-Windows . Make sure to checkout the v2 branch. Once downloaded an extracted, open the ConsumerVPN.sln file in the extracted folder. The application is a Microsoft .NET C# WPF application. It follows the normal MVVM patterns associated with a WPF application. This document does not detail the code in the application but how to change the look of the application generated from the code. The application targets .NET Framework 4.6.2 and you may need to install the targeting pack for that or alternatively change the target to .NET Framework 4.7.2. To install .NET framework 4.6.2 either use Visual Studio Installer or download it directly from Microsoft website: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53344 We use the WiX toolset for building installers. You will also need to download and install the WiX Toolset build tools and WiX Toolset Visual Studio Extensions that are compatible with your environment from this link: http://wixtoolset.org/releases/ . The Wix installation will require you to enable .NET 3.5 on your machine. If WiX does not automatically do this for you, perform the following instructions: Press “ Windows Logo ” + “ R ” keys on the keyboard. Type “ appwiz.cpl ” in the “ Run ” command box and press “ ENTER ” on the keyboard or click Run . In the “ Programs and Features ” window, click on the link “ Turn Windows features on or off ”. Check if the “ .NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0) ” option is available in it. If yes, then enable it and then click on “ OK ”. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation and restart the computer, if prompted. If you run into any errors, the following link will provide information from Microsoft on how to solve any potential issues. https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-instal-net-framework-35-on-windows-10/450b3ba6-4d19-45ae-840e-78519f36d7a4?auth=1 Localization The application supports different languages. Currently, there're English, Spanish, Hindi and Russian language strings available in this repository. You can add your own translation to any other languages. To do that, create a new resource file with the next name Strings.xx.resx under ConsumerVPN->Properties, where xx is 2-letter ISO language name (ex. en , bg , de ). For better work with translations, we recommend you to install ResXManager from Visual Studio Extensions portal. For Visual Studio 2019, you can find the extension here: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TomEnglert.ResXManager . Adding new languages and translations is much more easier with the ResXManager extension. Navigating the project Solution Structure The application is divided in to the following solution structure. Folder / Namespace Explanation / Usage Behaviors WPF behavior utilities Controls Custom controls and visual states Enums Various application enumerables Extensions Custom utility class extensions Factories Factory classes that the app uses Helpers Utility classes for dealing with all kinds of data Input Multi Key Gesture classes for hotkeys support Interfaces All interfaces Resources All visual resources are stored here. You will most likely be working in here. There is a branding subfolder in this which contains all the files required to be modified to make the application visually yours. Utils Utility classes ValueConverters Data converters for UI elements ViewModels View models (for standard MVVM development) for all views in the application. Views All the views the application uses. Things to change when branding Application Settings In the ConsumerVPN application properties (found by right clicking on the project in the solution explorer and then going to settings on the left-hand side bar) you will find the following settings.

Application name and namespace Under the Application section of the project properties, you will want to change the field Assembly Name to something along the lines of your application brand. For example, if you were called ExampleVPN , it would be suggested to call it ExampleVPN . As well as this, you should changed the Default Namespace to CompanyName.ApplicationName . Visual Studio will assist you in updating all the namespaces in the project files automatically, except namespaces in XAML files, that you will have to update manually. Visual Settings Each of the files in the Resources folder may be changed to have your visualization, especially files starting with Branding.* . Each file will be discussed in this section. Branding.System.xaml The Branding.System.xaml file is a WPF resource file that defines application settings. ApiKey and AuthenticationToken will need to be updated to match the data provided to you by WLVPN SDK to ensure you're able to authorize to the backend and use all functionality. <!-- Application Name --> <system:String x:Key=\"ApplicationName\">ConsumerVPN</system:String> <!-- WLVPN API Key.

Nearly every color can be modified to your hearts content to ensure your application color scheme fits with the palette you wish to use for your brand. Image Assets Within the Resources/Icons/ and Resources/Images/ folders, you will find multiple images to replace to make the client look how you wish it to. Keep in mind, it is suggested to keep them the same size unless you intend on modifying the view XAML files to fit everything correctly. Image Description Image Filename An image of the countries on earth done in the style of a dot painting. This shows on the main screen, when a VPN connection is established. (520x263) DottedMap.png An image of the icon used for the system tray icon as well as the logo in the about screen. Ensure this is a multi-dimension (16x16 up to 256x256) .ico file.

If you leave it as is, it should be fine. If you change the application logic and add any 3rd party libraries, you will need to update this file with the appropriate licenses. Building the Application and making it yours Getting the Code The code is kept in a git repository at https://github.com/wlvpn/ConsumerVPN-Windows/tree/v2 . Clone the repository using your git client of choice on to your local machine. The solution file in the repository is named ConsumerVPN.sln . Using an instance of Visual Studio 2019 running as an administrator , open the ConsumerVPN.sln file to begin. Configuring Visual Studio to use the WLVPN NuGet feed Your account manager will provide you the details required to add the private WLVPN NuGet feed to your instance of Visual Studio. Using the provided details, follow the instructions provided by Microsoft here on how to add an external NuGet repository, this will allow you to use the VpnSDK package as well as others that may be required depending on your requirements. (Note: Do not follow any instructions past the linked paragraph as they are for VSTS configurations.) Changing the Branding You can change all the colors and links used by the application by changing values in the Branding.Colors.xaml and Branding.General.xaml file. Start by changing one of the colors to something glaring and then looking at the application to better understand the relationship between the definitions and where they are used in the application. For instance, changing one of the default accent colors to Orange gives us the following. AccentColor to Orange <Color x:Key=\"AccentColor\">Orange</Color> Another example would be changing the WindowBackgroundColor key to Green. Content Control color to Green <Color x:Key=\"ContentBackgroundColor\">Green</Color> All of these resources can be found in {PROJECT_ROOT}\\src\\ConsumerVPN\\Resources\\ . Just as you can easily change the colors or the images by modifying the files in the Branding folder, you can modify all the text strings in the Strings.XX.resx files, where XX is 2-letter ISO country code."

    "title": "Quick Start | VpnSDK v2 - WLVPN .NET Framework SDK",
    "keywords": "Quick Start Introduction VpnSDK v2 is a pure async/TPL library that abstracts all WLVPN and VPN connectivity in to an easy to use SDK. In the following code example, the simplicity of getting started is shown through a code example that you can use as a base for a console application. It is suggested that you read through the code and try running it yourself, make your own adjustments along the way to get a good feel for how it works. Getting Started Assuming you have added the NuGet repository provided to you by your account holder, create an empty .NET Console application targeting .NET 4.6.2 at minimum. You will also require a version of Visual Studio that has support for C# 7.1. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/configure-language-version outlines how to select the required C# version. If this isn't possible, you will need to adapt the async Task Main() method to create a method where you can run async operations. In your new project import \"VpnSDK 2.0.x\" from NuGet and copy the following code. You will need to read through the code and provide your own API keys and authorization tokens. The Code using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text; using System.Threading.Tasks; using System.Web; using VpnSDK; using VpnSDK.Enums; using VpnSDK.Interfaces; namespace WLVPN.Example { class Program { public static string WLVPN_API_KEY = \"ASK_YOUR_ACCOUNT_MANAGER_FOR_THIS\"; public static string WLVPN_AUTH_TOKEN = \"@ASK_YOUR_ACCOUNT_MANAGER_FOR_THIS\"; public static string WLVPN_USERNAME = \"FAKE\"; public static string WLVPN_PASSWORD = \"FAKE\"; static async Task Main(string[] args) { // Build an SDK instance using the info your account manager has provided. // If you do not have these, please contact WLVPN. ISDK sdk = null; try { sdk = new SDKBuilder<ISDK>().SetApiKey(WLVPN_API_KEY).SetAuthenticationToken(WLVPN_AUTH_TOKEN) .SetApplicationName(\"Console Example\").Create(); } catch(Exception e) { Exit(e.Message); } WriteInfo(\"SDK instance constructed.\"); WriteInfo(\"Ready to authenticate.\"); // Using your WLVPN customer credentials, authenticate against the WLVPN API. try { await sdk.Login(WLVPN_USERNAME, WLVPN_PASSWORD); } catch (Exception e) { Exit($\"Unable to authenticate. {e.Message}\"); } // You can access the users basic info using the User object in the SDK. // You can also get the users current GeoIP information if it is important to your UI/UX.

IConnectionConfiguration rasConfiguration = new RasConnectionConfigurationBuilder() .SetConnectionType(NetworkConnectionType.IKEv2).Build(); // Now that we have a configuration object, we can connect. First let's get an ILocation from our Locations collection.

For more information, consider studying our ExampleApp found at https://github.com/wlvpn/ExampleApp-Windows/tree/v2 or reviewing the API reference. Due to the simplicity in version 2 of the SDK, many barriers have been removed, simple events have replaced observable chaining and going from nothing to a working VPN connection is faster than ever before."
